# About

Welcome! This is a small GUI wrapper for `yt-dlp` intending to make it very user-friendly and easy to use. I don't really plan to update this at all, but if there's a feature you'd like to see lemme know and I might add it.

# Installation

- Download the `.exe` file from the Releases page. You may get an antivirus warning, you may click "Ok" to continue anyway.
- Run the file. You may get a Windows Defender warning, to continue, click `More Info` and then `Run Anyway`
- And you're done!!

# Usage

- Select Output Location

Click this button to choose which folder your video is downloaded to. Default location is the users home directory.

- Download Playlist?

Choose whether or not to download the whole playlist, if the link includes a playlist. Default does not download the playlist, check it to download the playlist

- Download Video/Audio

Choose to download either a video file, or audio file (mp3). If you'd like to download both, download twice with each option selected.

- Recode To .mp4?

If enabled, makes the final video file an `.mp4` file. If enabled, the download will take longer and the program may not respond for a bit; don't worry! It's still working, it will just take a moment.

- Enter Target Link

Link to the video you'd like to download. All youtube links work, as well as all sites listed [here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md).

- Download

Click this button when you've got all your settings filled in and have a link to download!

- Command Preview

This is a preview of the options that will be used when you press Download. Most users will not have to worry about this, but if you're curious the items of the list are `['ffmpeg location', 'postprocessor settings', 'format', 'recode', 'no playlist', 'output location', 'download link']`.
